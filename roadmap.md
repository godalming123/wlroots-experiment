# Roadmap
My file to organise all the things in this project that I need to do and have done.
## ToDo
 - Add layer shell protocol
 - Make the windows take up the whole screen
 - Allow fullscreen window switching with `Alt` + `D` and `Alt` + `A`
## Done
 - Add a kegbinding (`Alt` + `Return`) to launch a terminal (alacritty)
